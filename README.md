GeneExt takes as input scRNA-seq mapped reads and a gene annotation file (GTF or GFF, any version) and outputs an extended gene annotation file for improved scRNA-seq transcript quantification.

# Installation  
> **Note:** Users lacking a Conda installation are recommended to install [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#miniforge).

Tool dependencies can be installed with `conda` or `mamba`:

```bash
# create environment
conda env create -n geneext -f environment.yaml

# activate environment
conda activate geneext
```

# Test run
Once dependencies are installed, try running `GeneExt` with sample data:

```bash
python geneext.py -g test_data/annotation.gtf -b test_data/alignments.bam -o result.gtf
```

Please, first test whether the tool works properly on the test data! 

For details on how to obtain alignment file, please refer to the [manual](Manual.md).   
If problems persist, don't hesitate to contact the authors.
